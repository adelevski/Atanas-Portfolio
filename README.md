My portfolio of projects

--------------------------------------------
## [UIC Work](https://github.com/adelevski/UIC)
### (1) [Neural Networks Final Project](https://github.com/adelevski/UIC/tree/master/ECE%20559%20-%20Neural%20Networks/Final)
* Created a custom environement and trained a Q-Learning model to play
* Keras DNN for classifying 8 different types of datapoints

### (2) [Computer Vision Class](https://github.com/adelevski/UIC/tree/master/ECE%20515%20-%20Computer%20Vision)
* Lane Detection using Hough Transform, Projective Transform, and Spatial CNN
* Used compostion along with Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids for image processing
* Practiced doing rotations, translations and other image processes using homogenous coordinates

### (3) [Machine Learning Class](https://github.com/adelevski/UIC/tree/master/ECE%20407%20-%20Machine%20Learning)
* MNIST Logistic Regression Classifier
* KNN Classifier
* K-Means Clustering
---------------------------------------------

## [Style Transfer](https://github.com/adelevski/Style-Transfer)
* Used streamlit to create a fast and lightweight dashboard
* Leveraged PyTorch neural transfer for transfering image styles
* User has ability to upload an image, and view several different new styles for their image
